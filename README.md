# Accountability 

A Rust CLI tool that helps users keep track of different activities they want to be held accountable on. Stores files locally, so user can look back at them and the program can display different useful metrics to track progress. As I learn more about Rust I plan on adding different features to it but right now I would like to keep it fairly simple.
